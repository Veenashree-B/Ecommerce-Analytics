## 🎯 THE 8 KEY FINDINGS

| Finding | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **20% customers = 65% revenue** | Extreme concentration | VIP retention program |

| **35-40% customer churn** | Revenue at risk | Deploy win-back campaigns |
| **Delivery delays → no repeats** | 2% per day impact | Target <10 day delivery |
| **Regional profit gap** | Vary 8-12 margin points | Region-specific pricing |
| **New customers inefficient** | Low repeat rate | Improve onboarding |
| **Category loss-makers** | Some SKUs near-zero margin | Price increases needed |
| **Seasonal demand 2-3x** | Inventory challenges | Pre-position stock |

## 🎯 5 KEY NUMBERS

Memorize these 5 numbers for any conversation:

1. **10,000+** transactions (dataset size)
2. **20% → 65%** (customer concentration)

5. **+36%** (total profit potential)

## 💡 3 BIGGEST INSIGHTS

### #1: The Pareto Principle in Action
> "20% of customers generate 65% of total revenue. This means the business is heavily dependent on a small customer segment. If we lose just a few high-value customers, revenue drops significantly."

### #2: Discounts Are a Profit Killer
> "Analysis shows orders with 0% discount have 10.5% profit margin. Orders with 25% discount drop to 0.8% margin. Orders with 35%+ discount go NEGATIVE. High discounts increase volume but destroy profitability."

### #3: The Churn Crisis
> "35-40% of customers haven't purchased in 6+ months. Many of these are high-value customers. Retention is 5-7x cheaper than acquisition, yet we're not investing in churn prevention."

## 🎓 FOR INTERVIEWS

### Your Pitch (30 seconds)
> "I completed an end-to-end analytics project on 10,000+ retail transactions. I cleaned the data, engineered 8 new features, performed 8 detailed analyses, and built an interactive dashboard. The key finding: high discounts reduce profitability—discounts over 20% actually reduce profit to near-zero despite volume increase. I identified +12% profit improvement opportunity in the discount policy alone."

### Your Talking Points
- "I focused on business value, not just pretty charts"
- "Every decision was documented with clear reasoning"
- "My recommendations are prioritized with ROI attached"
- "The most surprising finding was the discount paradox"

### Your Limitation
- "I see correlation between delivery and churn, but need A/B test to prove causation"
